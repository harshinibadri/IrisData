# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project uses the well-known Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The classification task is performed using a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict the species of an Iris flower.

## Steps Performed

### 1. **Import Necessary Libraries**
We imported several Python libraries required for data manipulation, machine learning, and model evaluation:
- **pandas**: For handling and manipulating the dataset.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib and seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **sklearn.datasets**: To load the Iris dataset.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: For splitting the data into training and test sets.
- **sklearn.preprocessing**: For standardizing the data.
- **sklearn.ensemble**: For the Random Forest Classifier model.
- **sklearn.metrics**: To evaluate model performance.
- **joblib**: To save the trained model for future use.

### 2. **Load the Iris Dataset**
We loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`. This dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 4 features for each flower:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

The target variable (`y`) is the species of each flower, which has three possible values:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

We converted the dataset into a `pandas DataFrame` for better readability and easier data manipulation. We also added the species labels as a new column in the DataFrame.

### 3. **Data Exploration**
We explored the dataset by printing the first few rows using `df.head()` and visualized the relationships between the features using `seaborn.pairplot()`. This visualization helps to understand how the features relate to each other and how they vary across different species of Iris flowers.

### 4. **Data Preprocessing**
Before training the model, we standardized the features using `StandardScaler`. Standardizing ensures that all features have the same scale (mean of 0 and variance of 1), which is important for many machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest.

### 5. **Train-Test Split**
The dataset was split into a training set and a test set using `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`. We used 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing the model's performance. This allows us to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

### 6. **Model Selection and Training**
We selected the **Random Forest Classifier** for this task, which is an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy. We trained the model on the training data using `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`.

### 7. **Model Evaluation**
After training the model, we made predictions on the test set using `model.predict(X_test)`. We evaluated the model's performance using several metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **Classification Report**: A detailed report showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (species).
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing how many samples were correctly or incorrectly classified for each species.

### 8. **Model Saving**
Once the model was trained and evaluated, we saved the trained Random Forest model to a file using `joblib.dump()`. This allows the model to be reused later without retraining.

### 9. **Making Predictions with the Saved Model**
To demonstrate how the trained model can be used for making predictions, we loaded the saved model using `joblib.load()`. We then provided a new sample (flower measurements) to the model for classification. The model predicted the species of the Iris flower based on the input features.

### 10. **Code for Prediction**
We provided a function that takes a new sample with sepal and petal measurements, scales the features (using the same scaler applied during training), and uses the trained model to predict the species of the flower. The predicted species is then printed.

### Example of Prediction:
```python
# Example: Predict the species of a new sample
new_sample = np.array([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]])  # Setosa
prediction = model.predict(new_sample)
print(f"Predicted species: {iris.target_names[prediction][0]}")
```

### 11. **Model Performance**
The model achieved an **accuracy of 100%** on the test set, indicating that it was able to correctly classify all samples. This is expected given that the Iris dataset is relatively simple and well-behaved for classification.

### Files:
- `iris_rf_model.pkl`: The trained Random Forest model saved for future use.
- The Python script containing the full code for training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow for classification, including:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model selection, training, and evaluation
4. Saving and reusing the trained model for predictions

The Random Forest Classifier was successfully used to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project provides a good foundation for understanding classification tasks and machine learning pipelines.
